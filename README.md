Question: Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
Answer: Statically typed programming languages require that the data type of a variable be explicitly declared before it can be used in the code. In other words, the type of a variable must be known at compile-time. Examples of statically typed programming languages include:
    Java
    C++
    C#
    Swift
In contrast, dynamically typed programming languages determine the data type of a variable at runtime, meaning that the type of a variable can change dynamically as the program is executed. Examples of dynamically typed programming languages include:
    JavaScript
    Python
    Ruby
    PHP
Dynamically typed programming languages are typically easier to learn and use, as they allow for more flexible and rapid development. On the other hand, statically typed programming languages can catch certain types of errors at compile-time that would otherwise only be caught at runtime in dynamically typed languages, leading to better code quality and stability in some cases.

Queston: Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined’
Answer: ‘undefined’ is a value assigned to a variable when it has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it. It is also the value returned when you try to access a non-existent property of an object.
‘null’ is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It can be assigned to a variable to explicitly indicate that the variable has no value. 
In other words, undefined represents the lack of a value, while null represents the intentional assignment of a lack of a value.
